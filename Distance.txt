To calculate the distance between two points on the Moon using latitude and longitude, you can adapt the Haversine formula or use spherical geometry. This method is based on a spherical approximation of the Moon's surface.
Steps to calculate the distance:

    Assume a spherical Moon: The average radius of the Moon is approximately 1,737.4 km.
    Use the Haversine formula: This formula computes the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes.

Haversine Formula:
a=sin⁡2(Δϕ2)+cos⁡(ϕ1)⋅cos⁡(ϕ2)⋅sin⁡2(Δλ2)
a=sin2(2Δϕ​)+cos(ϕ1​)⋅cos(ϕ2​)⋅sin2(2Δλ​)
c=2⋅atan2(a,1−a)
c=2⋅atan2(a
​,1−a
​)
d=R⋅c
d=R⋅c

Where:

    ϕ1,ϕ2ϕ1​,ϕ2​ are the latitudes of the two points in radians.
    ΔϕΔϕ is the difference between the latitudes.
    ΔλΔλ is the difference between the longitudes in radians.
    RR is the Moon's radius (1,737.4 km).
    dd is the distance between the two points.
